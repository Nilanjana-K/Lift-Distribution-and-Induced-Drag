# Wing Lift Distribution and Induced Drag Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB scripts to analyze **spanwise lift distribution**
and estimate **induced drag** for finite wings using classical aerodynamic theory.

The objective is to study how wing geometry and lift distribution influence
induced drag and overall aerodynamic efficiency.

---

## Scope of Analysis
- Spanwise lift distribution modeling
- Induced drag estimation
- Effect of aspect ratio and lift distribution shape
- Comparison with ideal (elliptical) lift distribution

---

## Methodology
The analysis is based on:
- Finite wing aerodynamic theory
- Classical induced drag relations
- First-order analytical and numerical modeling

The focus is on **physical understanding and trend analysis**, not high-fidelity CFD.

---

## Usage
1. Open the folder in MATLAB  
2. Run the scripts to compute lift distribution and induced drag  
3. Modify wing parameters to study sensitivity  

---

## Purpose
This project is intended for:
- Academic learning
- Aerodynamics concept validation
- SFRP and research preparation
